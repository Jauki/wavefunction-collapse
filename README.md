# Wavefunction Collapse 🌊🏄‍♂️

Wave Function Collapse (WFC) is a computational method for generating patterns that exhibit certain desired properties. It has gained popularity in recent years as a tool for creating unique and coherent images, animations, and other media.

The WFC algorithm works by starting with a set of input data, such as a small image or a set of rules, and iteratively extending it to create a larger output. The output is created by imposing constraints on the possible configurations of the output, such as ensuring that adjacent pixels or tiles have similar or related colors or patterns.

One of the key features of WFC is its ability to generate patterns that are both varied and coherent. This makes it a useful tool for tasks such as texture synthesis, where the goal is to create a larger texture that looks similar to a small sample image, or for creating procedural content, such as game levels or virtual environments.

In this project, you will explore the capabilities of WFC and its potential applications. This may involve implementing the algorithm in code, testing it on different types of input data, and analyzing the output to understand its properties and behavior.
